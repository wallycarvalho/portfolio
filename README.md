## This Project


This is the home repo for my portfolio. Welcome! ðŸ˜‡

Here you can find some of the tooling and frontend techniques that demonstrate some of the qualities I have as an engineer. As of March of 2024, this is still very much in development. Please navigate to the **Issues** or **Project** tabs to check the project's status as well its roadmap.

## Branching Naming Strategy

Throughout my career I have tried a handful of strategies and they all worked. For this project, I will use the following pattern:

- users/username/workitem

Feature branches should follow the `feature/feature-name` pattern that is widely used by most engineering teams. Same applies for bugs and hotfixes. They will contain a prefix to help identify what branch's purpose.

## Commit Strategy

 For this project, I will follow a simple and effective pattern that has worked for teams I worked with:

 - _type_  _[optional scope]_: description


 > This is the pattern from [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Trunk-based Development

Ever since learning about trunk-based development in 2021, I really grow fond of the approach. I believe it allows engineers the flexibility and autonomy to, in addition to safely push new features, to experiment. I am a big proponent of novel solutions and experimentation, so to me it's a no brainer.

For platform, I considered three platforms: PostHog, Unleash, and Growthbook. 

PostHog is very much like a complete platform that includes analytics and other interesting features but it is quite overwhelming for this use case. 

Unleash and Growthbook are a bit smaller and manageable so either works. Unleash it is. I made the choice based on how the UI looks because features offered they are both complete for me.


## Storybook

Most components were or will be built from scratch to demonstrate a few things I have in mind. The plan is to release a storybook page with all components built so you can see for yourself what I have built.
